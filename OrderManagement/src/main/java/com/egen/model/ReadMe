1. Understand the following legacy order schema:

order_id
order_status
order_customer_id
order_item_name
order_item_qty
order_subtotal
order_tax
order_shipping_charges
order_total
order_payment_method
order_payment_date
order_payment_confirmation_number
order_billing_addressline1
order_billing_addressline2
order_billing_city
order_billing_state
order_billing_zip
order_shipping_addressline1
order_shipping_addressline2
order_shipping_city
order_shipping_state
order_shipping_zip

2. Design a new database schema that:
	a. follows the concepts of Database Normalization. You remember that from your
	DBMS class. Sorry to take you back to those haunting memories. K

	b. provides an ability to have more than 1 item per order. What order schema in 2020
	limits to 1 item per order? J

	c. provides an ability to pay the order by accepting more than one payment
	transactions. For example, pay for an order amount using two credit cards (split
	the total). Make some assumptions about the billing address/es.

	d. adds other metadata to the order: createdDate, modifiedDate. What else?

	e. supports more shipping/delivery methods: In-store pickup, curbside delivery,
	ship to home, 3rd party delivery etc.
